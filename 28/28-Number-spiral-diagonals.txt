PROBLEM 28 - Number spiral diagonals
Given an integer n, find the sum of the numbers placed on the two diagonals of the matrix (or spiral) 
n*n. The matrix/spiral is formed starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise 
direction.

example:
n = 5
21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

The output should be the sum of 25, 21, 17, 13, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1. The answer is therefore 101.
